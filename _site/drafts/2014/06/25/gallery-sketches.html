<p>These ideas were created by participants of the IdeaShop (held at the MIT Media Lab in May 2014). They are currently in rough draft form. We welcome any feedback and questions you have as we work to refine these ideas.</p>

<h1>1. Real Machinists of Detroit</h1>

<p>Real Machinists of Detroit is a city-wide intervention that pairs skilled, unemployed labor with the needs of a city. RMD identifies a group of workers who have been laid off and seeks to capitalize on their skills whilst supporting them in the development of new skills necessary to take on modern challenges in the city. Each group would be supported by a mentor and in charge of managing and implementing a local project that benefits the community at large. For instance, there are many skilled machinists laid off with the decline of the auto industry whose skills could easily be repurposed to rebuild abandoned public space.</p>

<h1>2. What&#39;s My Path Forward?</h1>

<p>“What’s my path forward?” seeks to make promotion within an organization more coherent and transparent, catering specifically to low-skilled workers. In articulating the specific requirements and expectations of jobs within an organization, this idea helps employees who may otherwise feel stagnant in their role and overwhelmed by what is required to be promoted better manage their own trajectory. For instance, a dishwasher at a restaurant may feel a high barrier to promotion because she never fully understands the requirements of higher-paid jobs. If she could map out the expectations for promotion (fluent English, cash management), she could frame job training around the fastest track to promotion.</p>

<h1>3. Libranet</h1>

<p>In the past decades, the competitive advantage of libraries in a community is less about physical reading material and more about free access to the internet for everybody. A large component of web use in most library systems is job searching - indeed, some libraries have begun training staff to help visitors apply for jobs. Libranet seeks to formalize this role and supplement library services with access to informed job-search guidance. For example, a kitchen worker at 5 Guys might go to the library after work to look into other jobs in the food industry with more opportunity for advancement. On his own, this may seem a daunting task. However, after sharing his interests and validating his skills, he can use Libranet to make informed decisions about other jobs he may be qualified for that have a roadmap for advancement.</p>

<h1>4. ESL Pen</h1>

<p>ESL Pen is a lightweight, non-invasive way to document exploration of the English language for non-native speakers. With a corresponding earpiece, ESL Pen can not only remember what you write and play it back later, but also scan text and read it out loud in either English or native language. For example, a security guard who does not speak excellent English could use the Pen the supplement his work, not just to help him get through the day, but also to document places he is weak so that he can go back and study.</p>

<h1>5. Asyncronous Audio Learning</h1>

<p>Asynchronous Audio Learning (AAL) is a mobile tool that allows users to record audio and get near real-time translation. In addition to supporting comprehension in that moment, AAL archives recordings, allowing users to not only replay audio but also develop learning modules around text that is relevant to them. For example, a hospital employee may want to attend a lecture but worry that they won&#39;t understand everything. By recording on AAL, they can go back and listen on their commute home, supplementing the bits they don&#39;t understand with translation in their native language.</p>

<h1>6. Mentor Match</h1>

<p>Mentor Match pairs skilled, English-speaking community-members with low-skilled adult learners who are seeking new career pathways. Similar to online dating or volunteermatch.org, adult learners submit information about themselves and their goals and are paired with a community-member who can help motivate them and support them in their learning. For example, many banks require employees to do community service each year. These employees could have access to short biographies of adult learners who are looking for a mentor, or vice versa. In a facilitated environment, these pairs could meet and document progress.</p>

<h1>7. Random Events Lab</h1>

<p>Random Events Lab is a low-risk environment for individuals to come and receive job training, interview support, and mock situations. REL seeks to support users in better understanding expectations in a given workplace while still maintaining their individuality. REL consists of a series of life size projection screens that mimic real-life scenarios. For instance, a recent immigrant with a background in finance may come to better understand the expectations of the U.S. workplace and practice interviewing. Some of these scenarios may be automated but she may also have the opportunity to link up with potential employers and like-minded users who have common or complementary interests.</p>

<h1>8. Xpress Me</h1>

<p>Xpress Me is a mobile application designed to help users improve their basic literacy and numeracy skills while on their daily commute. It works by allowing the user to choose to &quot;passively learn&quot; (aka listen or read), or actively learn &quot;aka answer questions and challenges&quot;. By making learning accessible during commute times, Xpress Me works to facilitate quick wins that continually motivate the user to keep using the platform. For example, a department store worker who takes the bus to work daily may choose to use Xpress Me to explore the option of becoming a nurse, learn about the profession, identify the skills that she needs, and then gradually do the reading required for the training. That way, when she goes to enroll in a nursing certification program, she is already halfway towards completing the certification. </p>

<h1>9. Rich and Passion</h1>

<p>Rich and Passion seeks to support working students by creating a community for users to interact and offer academic support, motivation and help with non-academic needs. Based on co-located learners, users might ask for a ride to work if their car is broken down or find other students interested in building motorcycles to meet during the week. </p>

<h1>10. Foursquare for Learning</h1>

<p>Foursquare for learning aims to identify even the smallest chunk of time that a user has to learn and use the context around them to help them learn relevant skills. For example, suppose a user is at the grocery store, waiting in the checkout line after getting food for her kids dinner. Foursquare for learning may suggest some relevant articles on basic child nutrition that she could listen to via her headphones, or prompt her to do a basic calculation to see how much she is spending on bread. </p>

</center></p>

<h1>11. Tech Literacy</h1>

<p>Many adults use smartphones but don&#39;t understand their capabilities beyond basic functionality. Tech Literacy seeks to empower users to better understand their phones while at the same time gaining English proficiency. By linking mobile-based demos and tutorials with language modules, TL motivates English learners with the very pertinent goal of better understanding their device. For example, a recent immigrant with 2 children may need a phone to communicate with his children and look for work. He&#39;d have a easier time keeping in touch with his family in his home country if he could utilize free text applications. In his spare time, he could go through tutorials on his phone that not only teach him how to do this, but do so while bolstering his English proficiency.</p>

</center></p>

<h1>12. Storyteller</h1>

<p>Many parents want to learn English to converse with their kids, who are learning English in school. Storyteller is a kit of interactive storybook pieces that allow parents to make up a story by moving the characters around the pages of a storybook. The story is recorded and then parents are able to listen to their story and read it as they listen to the audio. This empowers them to be the “teacher” to their kids and also be creative (making up stories), as well as learning English vocabulary and practicing their speech and reading capabilities. </p>

<h1>13. DollarCount</h1>

<p>DollarCount is a way for adult learners who struggle with basic numeracy and arithmetic to learn the basics of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division while tracking something useful -- their income. Users can scan in their pay stubs, receipts, etc. and then are walked through the exercises of tallying up their expenses and subtracting it from their income. The level of difficulty can grow with the user -- more advanced students can use it to calculate tip or understand how much they paid per pound of potatoes at the grocery store. By using numeracy in the context of money, it helps adult learners not feel stupid (like when they are working from 1st grade textbooks), allows them to discreetly learn and save money while in line at the grocery store,  and empowers them to track their own spending.</p>
