For generations, libraries have played an integral role in local communities around the world. They are free, open community spaces with a focus on access and intellectual growth. But libraries are currently underutilized for adult learning solutions. Furthermore, in the past few years, a wealth of educational content has come online in the form of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). These courses and materials are freely available to anyone with a computer and internet access; however, they are underused by and for adult learners. It is from these two observations that Libranet emerged. 

__Libranet is a model for facilitating in-person study groups at community libraries, organized around open online learning courses and content. On top of these materials, the model scaffolds a community learning environment to actively foster academic mindsets that are critical to deeper learning and future success.__

Our first pilot of this model took place in May 2015, in collaboration with [Peer 2 Peer University](https://p2pu.org/en/) and [Chicago Public Libraries](http://www.chipublib.org/).
