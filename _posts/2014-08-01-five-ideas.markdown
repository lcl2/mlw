We spent the last few weeks narrowing down the 15 initial ideas. We evaluated the ideas on the basis of a few important questions: Is the tech novel? Is it able to be built in the next year? Is it deployable in a small pilot? Is it scalable through software?

What we came up with were five strong ideas that range from helping adult learners with cerfication courses, literacy, basic numeracy and skills building, and employment searches. Please check them out below.

# Foursquare for Learning
_Capitalize on downtime by prompting adult learners to complete learning assignments relevant to whatever it is they happen to be doing that day._

Foursquare for Learning is a mobile app that tracks your movement, detecting when you've entered a grocery store, a laundromat, or another "errand-like" location and prompting you with contextualized learning modules. For example, if you enter a grocery store you may be prompted with a nutritional budget that can help you plan a meal given your monetary constraints. Foursquare for Learning may also suggest some relevant articles on basic child nutrition that the user could listen to via his or her headphones, or prompt the user to do a basic calculation to see how much they are spending on bread. To the end user, the app hides out in the background most of the day, only popping up an alert when you are in an "errand location".  When you are in an errand location, you see a smartphone alert, asking you if you'd like to complete an exercise. 

There are two novel concepts with Foursquare for Learning. The first is location-based prompting, which in theory could push any notification or open app when a user enters a particular location (such as opening a news app when one gets on the subway in the morning). The second concept is designing learning modules that are contextualized to whatever it is that the user is doing at that particular moment. For example, while at a grocery store, a user may be presented with useful phrases to order food from the butcher and cheese counters.

There are a number of apps that use GPS to provide curated content. For example, Spotsy shows Instagram photos taken from nearby and Wikihood catalogues nearby Wikipedia articles. Many IFTTT recipes also capitalize on geo-referenced information. The most compelling is Moves App, which demonstrates that technology exists to develop location detection on top of the Foursquare API. Developers have begun creating modules embedded within Moves, allowing us the opportunity to design learning modules or prompt certain commands when the user arrives at a particular destination.

To test this idea, we will choose a narrow use case, such as a supermarket, and design a short learning module for users who enter the supermarket. In this instance, a supermarket may be compelled to partner with us as part of their corporate social responsibility, and also because the app could potentially tie into coupons and prompt users to buy a healthy meal around sale items.

#XpressMe
_Get certified and find a new job all on your commute to work._

Xpress Me is a mobile application designed to help users complete a certification program (e.g. a phlebotomy certificate) during their daily commute. Many continuing education certification programs are completed online already. By tailoring these programs to suit commuters,  Xpress Me capitalizes on downtime in the user's day. 

For example, a nurse who takes the bus to work daily may choose to use Xpress Me to explore certifications he can achieve to advance his career. If he commutes 45 minutes to work each way, he could theoretically complete a 100 hour certification course in 13 weeks. As XpressMe is designed specifically for commuters, each module is timed to the duration of his commute and users are made aware of other people on the bus who are working on similar certificates, in hopes of facilitating a community of learners on the bus. By advertising on the bus and prompting commuters to login to a local hotspot, we support learners in projects tailored to their skill level and desires.

The next step for this project is to research bus routes and the types of modules that can be completed during a commute. Additionally, we believe that we can tailor available modules to commuters based on when and where they commute to and from. Departure destinations will give us some insight into socioeconomic background whereas arrival destination will give us some insight into the type of work they do. Given that some certification programs only take 100 hours, it is possible that we could begin seeing results just 3 months after launching a pilot.

#Storyteller
_Bedtime stories for English learners of all ages._

Storyteller is a way for parents to practice speaking English by reading to their kids. When you open up the storyteller app, you are shown a gallery of recommended children's books and you can choose what book to read to your child. The app knows your native language and you can read the text in English and your native language side-by-side (English on top, native language underneath). You can also listen to pages read aloud in English and practice to read to your kids. If you don't understand a word, you can click on it and it give an image-rich explanation and translation. When you're ready to read it to your kids, you can reference how English sounds (via listening to the spoken audio) and know what the text means by reading it in your native language.

Besides providing an opportunity for parents to practice their English, Storyteller can help facilitate more parent-child interaction and increase the time-per-day that children are exposed to reading, which is shown to help improve comprehension skills.

Storyteller is a mobile/iPad app, allowing parents to use it anywhere they want in the house. There would also need to be a web app for story creation, making it easy for contributors (such as art students) to create stories for the storybook "store", complete with tutorials on how to make a good book for adult learners (stories with a lot of repetition, etc.). 

In its most simple form, Storyteller is a compilation of existing children's books. Down the road, authors and artists could get involved creating new books using a storybook-making web app. As a second phase, we could create an interface such that it is easy for a parent to create a book from pictures and then we could facilitate helping them create a story in English to read to their kids. This could become an integral part of the learning experience for the parent.  In a third phase, we could build a community of parents that are using the Storyteller app in order to allow them to recommend stories to each other.

# Libranet
_Beyond bookstacks - Utilizing libraries as bridges for meaningful employment_

For generations, libraries have played an integral role in local communities around the world. As libraries evolve to "facilitate knowledge creation" [1] in the digital age, there are many opportunities to support adult learners in their journeys towards a secure and fulfilling future.

At many libraries, a large component of web use is job search, especially for those adults who do not have consistent access to the internet at home or need the support of an intuitive path towards finding work. Indeed, some libraries have begun training staff to help visitors apply for jobs. Libranet seeks to embrace this trend by creating a network facilitated by the library for residents to explore career opportunities and help set their own career goals. 

When job seekers enter the library, they will log into Libranet on a local computer. Once logged in, they will be able to set and edit goals, search for jobs, and interact with a community of fellow job-seekers.  By doing this, Libranet finds new ways of collecting, extracting, and organizing data in order to make it sharable and actionable and helps find new ways to create value in libraries as community spaces of learning. Elucidating this previously hidden network of job seekers could lead to physical meet-ups, peer support groups, and perhaps skills building needs that the library could organize workshops around. 

With Libranet, libraries benefit because they obtain information about the skills employees have and the skills employers seek and then design seminars to match employees and employers (job training, information sessions, interviews). Employers may be prompted to come in for info sessions, interview practice, skills training, resume review, etc. For them the benefit is threefold: They get access to potential employees, gain professional development as teachers, and have the opportunity to increase brand awareness in local community. By expanding job search as a service at the library, librarians will also be able to serve their clients more effectively.

#Job Graph
_Capitalize on your loose network of connections for jobs at all skill levels_

The Job Graph is an application that allows low-income job seekers to utilize their friend and local community networks to get a job. While LinkedIn does this for high-income job seekers, only 12% of people who have achieved a high school diploma or less use LinkedIn.  However, 71% of this user group use Facebook [2] . While Facebook is not a targeted job-search tool, it does contain employment information that many users add to their profiles. Furthermore, there are a number of other resources such as Craigslist, newspapers and usa.gov that advertise jobs, albeit in an often not intuitive manner.

Users would log in via Facebook and have the option of either building a profile or searching for jobs directly. Users have access to a map of nearby jobs, pulled from scraping the aforementioned resources that they can sort by relevant characteristics (industry, salary, skills, etc). As users login via Facebook, a resumé can be automatically compiled through their Facebook profile and users can find out if anybody in their Facebook network works at one of the businesses they are considering applying to. Information is presented visually, with the ability to translate and listen, so as to cater to the widest possible population.

The Job Graph could target any number of subgroups, such as community college students, who could share their information in exchange for information about where their extended network of peers have worked. While we can't get much useful data about your friend's jobs from Facebook without a critical mass of users, by using Facebook login we can back into available data in order to construct a more robust picture of local job markets.
