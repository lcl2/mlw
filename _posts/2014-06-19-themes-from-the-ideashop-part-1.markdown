__Caption__: Wall of themes that emerged from the IdeaShop on adult learning on 5/22-5/23

At the IdeaShop on adult learning held at the Media Lab in May, participants worked together to develop the a common list of themes that they felt described the field of adult learning. The original "theme wall" (shown above), will be crucial in helping us determine the motivations and values of adult learners, as well as the barriers they face and the tactics tried in the adult learning field today. These themes are explained below.

# 1. Emotional Barriers
Many adult learners who lack basic literacy and math skills have grown up being called dumb in school by their peers (and sometimes their teachers). They often feel embarrased that they do not have these skills, helpless in situations where they need to read or do basic math, and fearful that others will find out. Sometimes even a person's significant other may not be aware. Imagine struggling to count out your pills or read a traffic sign? How would that make you feel? These barriers need to be overcome in order for a person to seek out traditional literacy and basic skills programs.

# 2. Literacy
Literacy is a topic that pervaded our list of themes. And how could it not? 36 Million Americans perform below Level 2 in literacy and numeracy on the [2012 Programme for International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC)](http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/results/summary.aspx). And this number does not just reflect Americans who grew up without exposure to English as children, but also kids who didn't (or in some cases did) finish high school without learning to read. There are not many jobs that do not require basic literacy and numeracy (being able to read traffic signs, count, make change), and there is the possibility of significant harm if you cannot read or write. Imagine giving your kids the wrong dose of medicine because you can't read the bottle?

> A man in California speaks about his own loss of identity, of self-location, definition: "I stood at the bottom of the ramp. My car had broke down on the freeway. There was a phone. I asked for the police. They was nice. They said to tell them where I was. I looked up at the signs. There was one that I had seen before. I read it to them: ONE WAY STREET. They thought it was a joke. I told them I couldn't read. There was other signs above the ramp. They told me to try. I looked around for somebody to help. All the cars was going by real fast. I couldn't make them understand that I was lost. The cop was nice. He told me: 'Try once more.' I did my best. I couldn't read. I only knew the sign above my head. The cop was trying to be nice. He knew that I was trapped. 'I can't send out a car to you if you can't tell me where you are.' I felt afraid. I nearly cried. I'm forty-eight years old. I only said: 'I'm on a one-way street ...'" [1]


# 3. Life Barriers
To attend a traditional skills course, literacy course, or a community college / trade school, there is a significant cost. Even if the program is free, you are giving up time. Time to relax, time with your kids, and even basics like time to sleep.  You may have to find someone to watch your kids (and that might cost money). Or you might have to gives up a job that gives you money to feed your family. Regardless of situation, time and cost are limiting factors that prevent people from pursuing traditional adult education.

> Jorge Delgado, the assistant principal at Carlos Rosario International Charter School, says many of these adult students make _incredible sacrifices_ to come to class. Forty percent have school-age children, and some send money home to support their families. The other day, Delgado remarks, he was leaving at 3 o'clock in the morning and when he went to pay for parking, at the cash register was one of his students. I said, "Don't you have class at 8am? When do you get out?" He responded, "5 in the morning". [2]

# 4. Pathways
As a society we seem to accept that the prime time for learning is from 5 to 18 years old, from 1st to 12th grade. But what happens if you miss that time slot? What alternative paths do we have for adult learners?

Why do we force adult learners to conform to classroom environments? To twice a week instruction. IdeaShop participants Adam Bush from [College Unbound](http://collegeunbound.org) and Kate Kazin from [College for America](http://collegeforamerica.org) shared their learning models, which both focus on developing competencies, not attendence in a classroom, as an alternative pathway for learning.

# 5. Motivation
One of the biggest motivators for adults to go back to school is to help their children. Think about it - who read to you as a kid? Who helped you learn fractions? Imagine if your parents couldn't do that. Imagine if your kids were more comfortable speaking a different language than you were? If they knew you couldn't read?

> A mother speaks about the inability to help her kids to read: "I can't read to them. Of course that's leaving them out of something they should have. Oh, it matters. You believe it matters! I ordered all these books. The kids belong to a book club. Donny wanted me to read a book to him. I told Donny: 'I can't read.' He said: 'Mommy, you sit down. I'll read it to you.' I tried it one day, reading from the pictures. Donny looked at me. He said, 'Mommy, that's not right.' He's only five. He knew I couldn't read ..." [3]

Another driving factor for adult learners is to improve job prospects. Being able to calculate a hourly rate, understand tipping, recite a menu to customers. 

> Ernsest Robertson is a part-time yard worker. He says no matter how many hours he worked, he only charged $20, because he didn’t know how to make change. Robertson remembers vividly all the times he’s been cheated. "I think it’s one price, and it’s always something else,” he says. “I think people can tell when you don’t know how to handle money. They know how to get you." [4]

# 6. Fun and Luxury

Luxury: Workshop participant Leonard Medlock from [EdSurge](http://www.edsurge.com) was the first to bring up the idea of luxury in learning, noting that these words are not often used together. However, for adults, learning is a luxury. It goes back to the theme of "life barriers" (2), where they are taking time away from other parts of their life in order to learn these skills -- attending a class is a luxury that they have worked for (and often times paid for). It they are not confortable in their learning environment, both in terms of it accomidating their schedule and also in terms of confort with the material and their peer group, then it will be hard for them to maintain their motivation.

Fun: We emphasize the fun in learning to kids, but not often to adults. We talk about basic skills aquisition as a chore, something that people should have already finished. We need to think about some of the way fun is cultivated in learning communities. The MIT Media Lab's Natalie Rusk helped introduce the group to how [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/)'s online community works and discussed some of the ways they make Scratch fun for learners.

# 7. Mentorship
Every learner needs someone that they can turn to for help, who is there to help motivate them. Many literacy programs pair volunteers with one of a few students so that they can work closely together and build up trust. This mentorship model, which requires trust between the students and with the teacher, allows students to ask questions when they do not understand something, without being afraid of being mocked or viewed as dumb (see Theme 1: Emotional Barriers). In theory, the mentorship model is great. However, it is time-intensive, both for the students and for the teacher, requires a long-term commitment on both parts, and can have varied outcomes depending on personalities, making it difficult to scale.

# 8. Credentialing
IdeaShop participant Michael Bettersworth from [Texas State Technical College System (TSTCS)](http://www.tstc.edu/frontpage/) told the story of a man who walked through the doors of TSTCS wanting to become certified as a welder. He didn't want to take a course -- he already knew how to weld -- but could not use his welding skills to get a job since he didn't have welding cerification from a American school. After 1 week in the shop, working with the welding instructor, he was able to demonstrate all the techniques that he needed to get his welding certification -- without ever having taken TSTCS's welding course.

Michael's story illustrates a need to help adult learners certify and market the skills that they already have. How do you certify the skills developed on the job that cannot be taught in the classroom? Is there a way to take the job experience that adult learners already have and repurpose it to count towards credintials that will help them get a job?
