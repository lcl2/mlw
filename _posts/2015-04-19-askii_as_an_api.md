As we built the SMS and mobile webpage learning system discussed in the post, [Creating Askii](http://learn.media.mit.edu/mlw/updates,/askii/creating_askii.html), we found we were most interested the algorithms behind the system. What are the algorithms that work best for interleaving review content? How do we do this in a short, confined timespan that is often needed in adult learning? 

Given this interest, we divided the Askii concept into two parts:

1. The client-side applications, which include the SMS and mobile webpage system for on-the-go learning.
2. The back-end, which is an API (application programming interface) for question and answer learning. 

More about this API will be coming out soon, including details of the API design. And it will all be open-source. So please check back for more details.
