And the site is live! 

This is where we will be posting updates on the Making Learning Work project.

For now, we are just getting started. Working off of the awesome ideas and discussion at the IdeaShop, we will be coming up with prototypes to improve basic adult education in the U.S.

For more context on the project, check out the [recent EdSurge article](https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-05-29-adult-learning-innovations-take-root-at-mit) about the IdeaShop
