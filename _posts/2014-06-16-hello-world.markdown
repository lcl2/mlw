And the site is live! 

This is where we will be posting updates on the Making Learning Work project.

For now, we are just getting started. Working off of the awesome ideas and discussion at the IdeaShop, we will be coming up with prototypes to improve basic adult education in the U.S.

For now, here are some quick stats on the problem space:

- 30 Million adults in the US struggle to read a pay stub, a menu, or a bus schedule [1]
- 46 Million adults find it challenging to do the most basic math [1]

For more context on the project, check out the [recent EdSurge article](https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-05-29-adult-learning-innovations-take-root-at-mit) about the IdeaShop
