We spent the last few weeks narrowing down the 15 initial ideas. We evaluated the ideas on the basis of a few important questions: Is the tech novel? Is it able to be built in the next year? Is it deployable in a small pilot? Is it scalable through software?

What we came up with were five strong ideas that range from helping adult learners with cerfication courses, literacy, basic numeracy and skills building, and employment searches. Please check them out below.
